# Shared Counter Part I

This is an activity for FSWD Lesson 5.7.1- Fetching Data From a Server.

Please refer to the Activity Guide in Canvas for directions.


## The Canvas activity was broken for windows machines
- We built one from scratch using some mockapi endpoints
- append the data from users and vehicles to the tables
- Make your own api on mockapi.io and put the data in a new table
