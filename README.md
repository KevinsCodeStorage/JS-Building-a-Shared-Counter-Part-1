# Shared Counter Part I

This is an activity for FSWD Lesson 5.7.1- Fetching Data From a Server.

Please refer to the Activity Guide in Canvas for directions.


## The Canvas activity was broken for windows machines
- We built one from scratch using some mockapi endpoints
- append the data from users and vehicles to the tables
- Make your own api on mockapi.io and put the data in a new table

## Part 2
- Goal: create a new vehicle or user using a button click

### Tasks
- create a button in html
- create a function in `public/index.js` for creating your resource
- register a click listener or invoke the function in the `onclick=yourFunction()` attribute of the button
- make a fetch POST request to one of the endpoints, then verify that the GET endpoint returns at least one more entry (another student may add one in meantime)
- look at [example request diagram](request-diagram.PNG)
